I'm definitely not a expert, actually can't recall much of what I learned from my master's degree course back in...don't wanna remember the year anyways. It's just an excuse not to feel so dumb as I do these days. I'll start with the logistic map, which is archetypal and easy but wanna explore concepts such as attractor."

    "The logistic map is a mathematical sequence defined by a recursive relation, not sure if this is what is meant by \"map\". The recurrence relation is extremely simple but an important thing is that it is non-linear, apparently. Let's look at the equation that defines it:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\displaystyle x_{n+1}=rx_{n}\\left(1-x_{n}\\right)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Anticipating things a little bit, but for different values of this $r$ parameter, we will end up having very different behaviours for this sequence when $n\\rightarrow \\infty$. Also important to note that these $x_i$ have their values bounded in $[0,1]$, because in the original model they represent a ratio between a population and a maximum population that the environment is able to support. Fun fact, for $r>4$, the values just diverge and this does not hold anymore, so not a very good model but ok, we'll simply ignore them. Let's first define this recurrence relation as a Python function. We'll pass $r$ as a parameter of this function, I'm sure it will help to do it like that."

But yes, this sequence converges for this value of $r=0.5$, actually it converges for a wide range of values of $r$ but not to the same value, otherwise it would be very boring. Now let's see these different convergences and some particular values. Define a function that saves the iterations in a vector."
